The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework is an open source web application that explains secure coding principles in multiple programming languages. The goal of OWASP-SKF is to help you learn and integrate security by design in your software development and build applications that are secure by design. OWASP-SKF does this through manageable software development projects with checklists (using OWASP-ASVS/OWASP-MASVS  or custom security checklists) and labs to practice security verification (using SKF-Labs, OWASP Juice-shop, and best practice code examples from SKF and the OWASP-Cheatsheets).

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Our experience taught us that the current level of security of web-applications is not sufficient enough to ensure security. This is mainly because web-developers simply aren't aware of the risks and dangers that are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers.

Because of this we decided to develop a framework in order to create a guide-system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design from the start.
